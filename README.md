# Parking Lot Management Simulator

This parking lot management simulator is a command-line application that finds the closest parking spot available for your type of vehicle (car, truck, bike) and issues a ticket ID that can later be returned to re-open the respective parking spot. There are also display options that allow the user to see the number and locations of available parking spots for the type of vehicle specified and the locations of occupied vehicles for the type of vehicle specified.

All data specific to individual cars or info is encapsulated. Javadoc comments describe the majority of classes and methods. Exception catching is implemented for edge cases and invalid entries.
